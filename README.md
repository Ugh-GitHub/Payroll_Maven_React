# WIP: React.js and Spring Data REST
Duration: Couple of hours

test

Description: An easy [tutorial from Spring.io](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/) that showcases how Spring Data REST and React.js can be integrated.

Current Completion:
- [x] Part 1: Basic Features
- [ ] Part 2: Hypermedia Controls
- [ ] Part 3: Conditional Operations
- [ ] Part 4: Events
- [ ] Part 5: Securing the UI and API

Additional Objectives:
- [ ] Add tutorial code notes to repository for reference.
- [ ] Generate list of terms and definitions for [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/) personal glossary.
- [ ] Determine if there are other learning opportunities that are adjacent to this exercise and complete ([such as this tutorial from Dimitri Mestdagh](https://dimitr.im/bundling-react-spring-boot)).
- [ ] Develop a better understanding of Spring Data REST, document on Notion, and determine potential further learning opportunities.
- [ ] Develop a better understanding of Thymeleaf, document on Notion, and determine potential opportunities to integrate into future learning.
- [ ] Develop a better understanding of JPA, document on Notion, and determine potential opportunities to integrate into future learning.
- [ ] Develop a better understanding of H2, document on Notion, and determine potential opportunities to integrate into future learning.
