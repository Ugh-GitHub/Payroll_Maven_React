# WIP: React.js and Spring Data REST
Duration: Couple of hours

Description: An easy [tutorial from Spring.io](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/) that showcase how Spring Data REST and React.js can be integrated.

Current Completion:
[x] Part 1: Basic Features
[] Part 2: Hypermedia Controls
[] Part 3: Conditional Operations
[] Part 4: Events
[] Part 5: Securing the UI and API

Additional Objectives:
[] Add tutorial code notes to repository for reference.
[] Generate list of terms and definitions for [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/) personal glossary.
[] Develop better understanding of Spring Data REST, document on Notion, and determine potential further learning opportunities.
[] Develop better understanding of Thymeleaf, document on Notion, and determine potential opportunities to integrate into future learning.
[] Develop better understanding of JPA, document on Notion, and determine potential opportunities to integrate into future learning.
[] Develop better understanding of H2, document on Notion, and determine potential opportunities to integrate into future learning.
